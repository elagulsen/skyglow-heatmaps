The latitude is 39.656914 and the longitude is -76.530059 at the exact location at which I observed. The night was perfectly clear. Harford County is out in the country so there is very little light pollution. I can say that I have never seen so many stars in the sky in my life. It was a surreal experience. I am from a town similar to Newark, so I have never really seen the actual night sky without the effects of light pollution. The magnitude at this location must have been around 1 or 2, I cannot imagine the night sky being much more clear. I just thought about how in early civilizations there was no real light pollution like there is today, so the stars must have amazed those people. It used to be odd to think that people got so much use from the stars in the old days because I have not (due to light pollution). But after seeing them, I wish that there was less pollution because seeing n illuminated night sky is a joy that everyone should have, every night.   The night sky itself was unbelievable. I was able to see the night sky filled with stars. The backdrop was so dark that each star light up like a pinpoint of intense light. The color was invasive. Points of light lit up everywhere and created an intricate pattern across the sky. It was easy to identify constellations such as Orion. It was also easy to create shapes in my own mind, similar to how children make shapes out of the clouds. The night sky was an amazing thing to see. Overall, it was a great experience to see a night sky without the effects of light pollution. I hope to see more skies like this, so hopefully something can be done about light pollution to encourage viewing the night sky.","Rural, very low street lights.","United States - Maryland"

While there was some increased sky glow in the southwest direction (in the direction of the main highway), it was slightly less than in previous years, mainly due to a number of local businesses turning off their outdoor signs after closing as well as the number of vacant stores on the highway.    The area around Leo was actually intermediate between the Magnitude 4 chart and the Magnitude 5 chart.  When factoring in stars that were flickering in and out of visibility, the view was closer to the Magnitude 5 chart.  Using my method of looking for the dimmest star definitely visible in the area and looking it up on Cartes du Ciel (a computer sky chart program) to get the magnitude, I arrived at an estimate of magnitude 4.6, which is about par for this location on a clear moonless night.  Had I observed from the backyard, subject to the direct glare of the floodlights I mentioned in the location comments, the magnitude figure might get to 4 if I was lucky.","The location is suburban.  There is a streetlight across the street in front of the house.  A neighbor to one side has a floodlight.  Another individual in the neighborhood has a bright floodlight mounted on the second floor of his oversized house.  There are two enormous trees in the back and side yards plus one monstrous tree in the front yard.  Sighting had to wait until Leo was in an area of sky unobstructed by trees.  Observed from the side of the detached garage which blocked the direct light of the floodlights and the house blocked the direct light of the streetlight.","United States - New Jersey"
