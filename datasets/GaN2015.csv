No trees or other objects obstructed my view of the sky from the roof.   In this Activity, I was looking forward to learning how to identify a certain constellation, in this case, the constellation of Orion. From my roof, Orion was surprisingly easy to locate. The clear sky was perfect for observing. I visited this website before going on the roof, and I was able to gain an idea of what exactly I was looking for. The 3 stars that make up ""Orion's Belt"" were not too hard to find. After finding those, I looked for  Betelgeuse, located above the belt, and found it. The reddish tint of Betelgeuse was very clear, and that aided in the process of confirming I was looking at the correct constellation. I would like to go out on a spate night, from a different location, and compare my results.","United States - Colorado"
