Duraj Cleveland State PHY202 CSU#:2710    The clouds around 7 o'clock on Friday night, are believed to be of the stratus type, since they were very flaky, spanned out, and lower to the ground as compared to other cloud formations. In terms of the direction they were moving, however, it seemed as if, from my location on the front stoop of my porch, they were moving North. Also, about a quarter of the sky was filled with the haze of the sky and clouds, but details, not lacking in the least bit, were gathered about the night sky. For example, as I looked to the west, a faint glow was present in the night sky, but it was not being emitted from any particular object. After further investigation, it was learned that this glow in the western sky, about two hours after sunset, was the zodiacal light, being shone from the interplanetary dust. I found this rather interesting due to the fact that this light was not necessarily being produced by solidified objects in our space, but rather than the entire environment those objects inhabit.","My location is rather dark, as to compared to other locations in the city in which I reside. When saying lit, I mean there are more streetlights active on other streets than my own; along with porchlights that flood the narrow avenues, that can possibly hold an effect on viewing the nightsky on Friday, March 4th. So, my location was rather ideal, taking my suburban location into account, to view the sky. Which was very possible, with more than a quarter of the sky and its' inhabitants viewable--cloud types, directions, viewable light, haze and glow.","United States - Ohio"

From where I was out in the middle of the Mount Tabor Golf course, I did see Leo, as you said East.  it was easy to identify it because Route 80 was going east and that is where i found it.  speaking about that, I actually drove to 2 different places, here is why:     I drove to Huderden County, near New Jersey on a Farmland and I got a clear and best view of Leo and its stars.  Now when I drove Back to Mount Tabor which took me 45 minutes.  i noticed the sky was still more polutted than the farmland than Huderdon County.  Ironically, I realized that My town was under an airplane route that goes to JFK and Liberty Airport, and it was foggy there.  With Leo over there, I actually identified that it was sort of missing a few stars or two.  I had to pull out my 1970's ""useful and not outdated"" astronomy book to check and make sure it was Leo.  And it was on that Tuesday night compared that i was on private property farmland observing that i saw all of Leo's stars and the ""?"" as well completely compared to the Mount Tabor Golf Course.  Those were my results on that night because I was off from school on Tuesdays.","United States - New Jersey"

F. Hladyk) From where I was out in the middle of the Mount Tabor Golf course, I did see Leo, as professor Puzickiy said on the East direction.  It was easy to identify it because Route 80 was going east towards the end of the woods past the Mount Tabor Golf Course.  That is where I found the location of Leo.  Speaking about that, I actually drove to two different places in Northern New Jersey.  Here is my experiecne of my travels to observe Leo in the sky:     I drove to Huderdon County, near Penslyvanian border on a private Farmland.  As I got a clear sight in the sky of Leo and its stars of an backwards upsidedown question mark.  Now when I drove Back to Mount Tabor, which took me 45 minutes, I noticed the sky was still more polutted than the farmland than Huderdon County.  Ironically, I realized that the sky above Mount Tabor was under an airplane route that goes to JFK and Liberty Airport, and it leaves foggy messes behind.  While I was observing Leo in the sky, I actually identified that it was sort of missing a few stars or two because of one or two small clouds covering Leo's stars.  I had to pull out my 1970's ""useful and not outdated"" astronomy book to check and make sure it was Leo.  And it was on that Tuesday night compared that I was on private property farmland observing that I saw all of Leo's stars and the ""?"" as well completely compared to the Mount Tabor Golf Course.  Those were my results on that night because I was off from school on Tuesdays.","United States - New Jersey"

We expected to see more stars, as we have observed from this area in the past.    The faintest stars that we could see in Leo were as follows...    Iota Leonis (4.02)  Sigma Leonis (4.04)  Lambda Leonis (4.31)  60 Leonis (4.40)  54 Leonis (4.48)  72 Leonis (4.57)    Every once in awhile, we could just barely see 22 Leonis (5.30). It seemed to twinkle on briefly and then off for a longer period of time.    If the Moon had been in the sky, it would have been easy to confirm that there were high altitude ice crystals, but since GLOBE at Night takes place on moonless nights, we had to resort to other clues and so we looked at Sirius and the three belt stars of Orion. All four of these stars were a bit blurry and hence are suspicion that there were some high altitude ice crystals. Of course, it could have been some thin high altitude cloud, but either way, our view of the sky was not what it should have been due to atmospheric effects. In the past, we have easily seen stars between magnitude 5.5 and 6.0 from this area on moonless nights.    Submitted by:    James Durbano  Big Sky Astronomical Society (www.bigsky.ab.ca)","We observed the sky from the outskirts of Nanton. This is a small town (population 2000) located in rural Southern Alberta. There were approximately 40 street lights in the area. The closest light was about 100 m away and the furthest was about 500 m. This area is known as Phase 3 of the Westview Subdivision. There are five houses there and about 75 vacant lots. There was some snow on the ground, but not too much. There are very few trees in this area.","Canada"
