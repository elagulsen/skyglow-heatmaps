I was not able to report any clouds or haze in the sky. I spotted the 15 wide soft glow of the Gegenschein without even looking for it while it was only 40 up in between the Sickle of Leo and M44 in Cancer. I believe I might have just caught a glimpse of a magnitude +6.9 star below Betelgeuse, but cant be certain because of how distractingly bright Betelgeuse was. However, I have proven that on the best nights, I can see stars as faint as magnitude +7.0 overhead. Ive also proven that the galaxy M81 in Ursa Major is visible with the naked eye on those aforementioned nights. I like to say that I live under high quality Bortle Class 3 skies.","As for other aspects of my observing sight, I live out in the rural where the nearest yard lights are a half mile to my N, NW, and N. From where I observe I am only 15 feet from my house and have about 40 of my western horizon blocked by it and nearby trees. I also have forests covering a chunk of the horizon from the N to the E and all the way S (though the trees come nearest to me in the NE and SE). This is actually a good thing though, since as the nearest cities are in those directions (NNE, E, SE), the worst of their light pollution is blocked from my eyes. The biggest nearby city and thus my worst light-pollution dome is the one 21 miles to the SSE. Its a noticeable nuisance because there is some good stuff to the south. The darkest and clearest horizon for me is actually in a part of the sky I rarely view  the NW!","United States - Arkansas"

I feel the clean Colorado air made it an even better experience because there is low amounts of pollution, as well as slightly less atmosphere due to the higher elevation in this area.

It was nice that the moon was still not in sight to keep even more light off of the stars in the sky.  This experience made me excited and motivated to do this again.","For my dark sky observation, I hopped in a car with some buddies and headed up Flagstaff Road.  Very little light pollution is found up here.  Many trees were in the area but none obstructed my view of the stars.  No obvious man made structures in the vicinity.

The moon was bright tonight and the air was not completely clear, which made the magnitude higher than we think it normally would be, about a 3 or a 4. I was also able to spot the Big and Little Dippers, two constellations that were fairly easy to locate from the field. Usually the two are very clear, but just like Orion the magnitude was a 3 or a 4. Those were the only three constellations I was able to definitively locate, even with the help of a star map. I feel fortunate to live in an area where we have the opportunity to see stars in a close vicinity because all of these famous constellations are even more fascinating when you can see them yourself.

I think that due to the many  clouds I was not able to see any color in the sky or symmetry in  patterns of stars. I believe the faintest star I could see was in the 3rd magnitude.
